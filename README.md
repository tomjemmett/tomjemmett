# Tom Jemmett

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name's Tom, and I work for the NHS as a Senior Healthcare Analyst with the [Strategy Unit](https://www.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/). You can find some of our work [here](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit). I have worked within the NHS for over 10 years, previously working for The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust and The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust. I mostly code in R and Python, but have a love for Haskell.

I am an active member of the [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) where we try to promote the use of the R within the NHS and UK Health Sector. Check out our [github](https://github.com/nhs-r-community) profile to get involved!

I studied Computer Science and Pure Mathematics at the Open University, achieving a BSc with first class honours. I'm a member of the British Computer Society and and Associate Member of the Institute of Mathematics and it's Applications.
